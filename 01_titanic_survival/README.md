# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction (Advanced Feature Engineering & Ensemble Learning)

This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline built on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.  
It focuses on **advanced feature engineering**, **model comparison**, and **ensemble learning techniques**.

---

## 📌 Objective

Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using structured passenger data.

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights discovered during analysis:

- Gender had a strong impact on survival (female passengers had higher survival rate)
- Passenger class significantly influenced survival probability
- Family size affected survival (small families performed better than single or very large families)
- Age groups showed strong survival differences (children had higher survival rates)
- Fare and socio-economic status were highly correlated with survival

## 🤝 Ensemble Learning (Voting Classifier)

A soft voting ensemble was built using:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

This improved model stability and robustness.
